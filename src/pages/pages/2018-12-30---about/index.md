Instart came into existence as a lovechild of two of my favorite interests: generative art and building novel online businesses. I hope this project will help me advance on the path of success and by marrying the two ideas will bring joy to many people.

**So what is instart?** You might ask. It's an online t-shirt store where you can customize all designs which are generated by algorithms. I call these *design systems* each of which can be controlled by simple sliders / dropdowns / checkboxes. You might add text, change color palettes or crop the generated mess. This way my store has more combinations than I can count.

Happy exploration,

*Tibor*
